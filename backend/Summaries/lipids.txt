Lipids are molecules that are insoluble in water. They are found in fats, oils, and cell membranes. These molecules are made up mostly of nonpolar carbon-hydrogen bonds which cause them to spontaneously cluster together when placed in water. This cluster formation is important for the structure of cell membranes.
