"Learning informally of Franklin’s results before they were published in
1953, James Watson and Francis Crick, two young investigators at
Cambridge University, quickly worked out a likely structure for the
DNA molecule (figure 14.10), which we now know was substantially correct. They analyzed the problem deductively, first building models of
the nucleotides, and then trying to assemble the nucleotides into a molecule that matched what was known
about the structure of DNA. They
tried various possibilities before they
finally hit on the idea that the molecule might be a simple double helix,
with the bases of two strands pointed
inward toward each other, forming
base-pairs. In their model, basepairs always consist of purines, which
are large, pointing toward pyrimidines, which are small, keeping the
diameter of the molecule a constant
2 nanometers. Because hydrogen
bonds can form between the bases in
a base-pair, the double helix is stabilized as a duplex DNA molecule
composed of two antiparallel
strands, one chain running 3′ to 5′
and the other 5′ to 3′. The base-pairs
are planar (flat) and stack 0.34 nm
apart as a result of hydrophobic interactions, contributing to the overall stability of the molecule"
