Lipids are a loosely defined group of molecules with one
main characteristic: they are insoluble in water. The most
familiar lipids are fats and oils. Lipids have a very high proportion of nonpolar carbon-hydrogen (Câ€”H) bonds, and so
long-chain lipids cannot fold up like a protein to sequester
their nonpolar portions away from the surrounding aqueous
environment. Instead, when placed in water many lipid molecules will spontaneously cluster together and expose what
polar groups they have to the surrounding water while sequestering the nonpolar parts of the molecules together
within the cluster. This spontaneous assembly of lipids is of
paramount importance to cells, as it underlies the structure
of cellular membranes and other important organelles.
